# FitUltD

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FitUltD is to fit data that can't be fitted with ordinary density functions

## Installation

You can install the released version of FitUltD from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: 

install.packages("FitUltD")


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to fit a multimodal random variable:

```{r example}
library(FitUltD)
#random Variable
RV<-c(rnorm(73,189,12),rweibull(82,401,87),rgamma(90,40,19))
set.seed(31109)
FIT1<-FDistUlt(RV, plot=TRUE, subplot = TRUE)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
FIT1[[3]]

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
FIT1[[4]][[1]]
```

```{r plots-mult, echo = FALSE}
FIT1[[4]][[2]]
```
